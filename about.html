    <h2>Welcome to My Personal Page!</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Zainab Haidar, and i was born in 2003/12/31 in Ghazni province, in the district of
         Jaghori.
    I completed my school there and always had a deep passion for art. From a young age, I discovered my
    natural talent for drawing, and it quickly become one of my hobbies.I have always enjoyed creating
    beautiful works of art, and over time, I developed my skills further.
    During the free time, I immerse myself in creating art,as it brings me peace and serenity.
    When I paint, it's as if I disconnect from all the problems around me, and I find a sense of 
    tranquility for my mind and soul. For me painting is more than just a hobby; it's a therapeutic 
     journey that allows me to reconnect with myself.
